# The Viterbi Algorithm
# Written By: Garrett Rodrigues

This repository contains an implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm in python: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm

The algorithm is used to finding the most likely state sequence of a Hidden Markov Model, given the following:
    1) a sequence of observations
    2) a transition matrix that gives the probability of transitioning from one state to the next
    3) a emission probability matrix that gives the probability of seeing each observation given some state
    4) an initial probability distribution

viterbi_data.zip includes text files for each of the above, and the assignment is better described in the hw6.pdf which is from CSE250A at the University of California, San Diego.
